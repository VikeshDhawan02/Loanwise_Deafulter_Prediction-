# LoanWise_Defaulter_Prediction
This project aims to help lenders determine if a customer is likely to default on a loan by considering multiple
factors such as demographic, financial, and other relevant attributes. To achieve this, data was analyzed using
correlation checks, scatter plots, and basic descriptive statistics. Multiple machine learning classification algorithms
were tested.
